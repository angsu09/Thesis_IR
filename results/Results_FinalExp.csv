",How do you properly determine the current script directory?,"<p>I would like to see what is the best way to determine the current script directory in Python.</p>
<p>I discovered that, due to the many ways of calling Python code, it is hard to find a good solution.</p>
<p>Here are some problems:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>__file__</code> is not defined if the script is executed with <code>exec</code>, <code>execfile</code></li>
<li><code>__module__</code> is defined only in modules</li>
</ul>
<p>Use cases:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>./myfile.py</code></li>
<li><code>python myfile.py</code></li>
<li><code>./somedir/myfile.py</code></li>
<li><code>python somedir/myfile.py</code></li>
<li><code>execfile('myfile.py')</code> (from another script, that can be located in another directory and that can have another current directory.</li>
</ul>
<p>I know that there is no perfect solution, but I'm looking for the best approach that solves most of the cases.</p>
<p>The most used approach is <code>os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__))</code> but this really doesn't work if you execute the script from another one with <code>exec()</code>.</p>
<h2>Warning</h2>
<p>Any solution that uses current directory will fail, this can be different based on the way the script is called or it can be changed inside the running script.</p>

<p>Is there any way I can keep using the default value (empty list in this case) for the constructor parameters but to get both <code>a</code> and <code>b</code> to have their own <code>wordList</code> and <code>adjacencyList</code> variables?</p>

<p>I am using python 3.1.2.</p>
",Python constructor and default value,"<p>Anyone tinkering with Python long enough has been bitten (or torn to pieces) by the following issue:</p>
<pre><code>def foo(a=[]):
    a.append(5)
    return a
</code></pre>
<p>Python novices would expect this function to always return a list with only one element: <code>[5]</code>. The result is instead very different, and very astonishing (for a novice):</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5, 5, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
[5, 5, 5, 5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; foo()
</code></pre>
<p>A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it &quot;a dramatic design flaw&quot; of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>
<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/1137164/7487335"">Baczek made an interesting example</a>. Together with most of your comments and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/1134623/7487335"">Utaal's in particular</a>, I elaborated further:</p>
<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; def a():
...     print(&quot;a executed&quot;)
...     return []
... 
&gt;&gt;&gt;            
&gt;&gt;&gt; def b(x=a()):
...     x.append(5)
...     print(x)
... 
a executed
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5]
&gt;&gt;&gt; b()
[5, 5]
</code></pre>
<p>To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function, or &quot;together&quot; with it?</p>
<p>Doing the binding inside the function would mean that <code>x</code> is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the <code>def</code> line would be &quot;hybrid&quot; in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.</p>
<p>The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.</p>

","CSV file written with Python has blank lines between each row <p>I am using DictWriter to output data in a dictionary to a csv file.  Why does the CSV file have a blank line in between each data line?

<pre><code>headers=['id', 'year', 'activity', 'lineitem', 'datum']
output = csv.DictWriter(open('file3.csv','w'), delimiter=',', fieldnames=headers)
output.writerow(dict((fn,fn) for fn in headers))
