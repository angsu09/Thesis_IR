<p>A manager of mine once had his first encounter with this feature, and called it &quot;a dramatic design flaw&quot; of the language. I replied that the behavior had an underlying explanation, and it is indeed very puzzling and unexpected if you don't understand the internals. However, I was not able to answer (to myself) the following question: what is the reason for binding the default argument at function definition, and not at function execution? I doubt the experienced behavior has a practical use (who really used static variables in C, without breeding bugs?)</p>
<p><strong>Edit</strong>:</p>
<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/1137164/7487335"">Baczek made an interesting example</a>. Together with most of your comments and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/1134623/7487335"">Utaal's in particular</a>, I elaborated further:</p>

</code></pre>
<p>To me, it seems that the design decision was relative to where to put the scope of parameters: inside the function, or &quot;together&quot; with it?</p>
<p>Doing the binding inside the function would mean that <code>x</code> is effectively bound to the specified default when the function is called, not defined, something that would present a deep flaw: the <code>def</code> line would be &quot;hybrid&quot; in the sense that part of the binding (of the function object) would happen at definition, and part (assignment of default parameters) at function invocation time.</p>
<p>The actual behavior is more consistent: everything of that line gets evaluated when that line is executed, meaning at function definition.</p>
